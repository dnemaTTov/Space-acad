            The Earth's atmosphere mainly consists of nitrogen (78.08%), oxygen (20.95%), argon (0.93%) and carbon
            dioxide (0.04%), also depending on the climate, it can include 0.1 up to 1.5% water vapor.
            The average atmospheric pressure on Earth (at sea level) is 1 atmosphere (101.325 kPa).
            Three-quarters of the mass of the atmosphere is contained in the first 11 kilometers from the Earth's
            surface.
            The earth's atmosphere has no definite boundaries; it gradually becomes thinner and rarer, passing into
            outer space.
            The Earth's atmosphere is conditionally divided into layers that differ in density, temperature and
            composition: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, exosphere.

            The climate on our planet is seasonal due to the angle of inclination of the axis of 23.44 degrees.
            The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude.
            The earth is divided into climatic zones - natural zones that have an approximately uniform climate.
            In the KÃ¶ppen classification system, the criterion for determining the type of climate is what plants grow
            in a given area. The system includes five main climatic zones (moist tropical forests, deserts, temperate
            zone, continental climate and polar type), which, in turn, are divided into more specific subtypes.
            The water cycle in nature is vital for the existence of life on land.
            Sea currents are an important factor in the formation of the Earth's climate, as is the thermohaline
            circulation, which is created due to a difference in water density and transfers thermal energy from the
            equatorial regions to the polar regions.

            Approximately 70.8% of the planet's surface is occupied by the oceans.
            On the continents there are rivers, lakes, groundwater and ice, together with the World Ocean they make up
            the hydrosphere.
            The underwater surface is mountainous, includes a system of mid-ocean ridges, as well as underwater
            volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains.
            On land, mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus and other types of relief are distinguished.
            The Earth's poles are covered in an ice shell that includes the Arctic sea ice and the Antarctic ice sheet.
            Interesting Earth Facts
            Earth is the most explored planet in the solar system and the only habitable planet known to science.
            Earth is the densest planet in the solar system.
            Earth formed from the solar nebula about 4.5 billion years ago.
            The gravitational influence of the Moon on the Earth is the cause of ocean tides.
            The Earth is inhabited by about 8.7 million species of living beings, and man is one of them.
            The surface of the planet was constantly changing: continents appeared and collapsed, moved along the
            surface, either gathering into a supercontinent, or diverging into isolated continents.
            The fall of asteroids with a diameter of several thousand kilometers to the Earth poses a danger of its
            destruction, but all the observed bodies are too small for this and dangerous only for the biosphere.
            The Earth was first photographed from space in 1959 by the Explorer 6 spacecraft.
            The first person to see the Earth from space was Yuri Gagarin in 1961.
            From outer space and from planets located beyond the orbit of the Earth, one can observe the passage of our
            planet through phases similar to those of the moon.

            <span class="text-info h3">The internal structure of the earth</span> <br>
            Of the planets of its group, the Earth has the largest mass and therefore has the largest internal energy -
            gravitational and radiogenic, under the influence of which processes in the earth's crust are still ongoing,
            as can be seen from volcanic and tectonic activity. Although igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks have
            already formed, forming the outlines of landscapes, which are gradually modified under the influence of
            erosion.
            Under the atmosphere of our planet is a solid surface called the earth's crust. It is divided into huge
            pieces (slabs) of solid rock, which can move and, when moving, touch and push each other. As a result of
            this movement, mountains and other features of the earth's surface appear.
            The earth's crust is 10 to 50 kilometers thick. The crust "floats" on the liquid earth's mantle, the mass of
            which is 67% of the mass of the entire Earth and extends to a depth of 2890 kilometers!
            The mantle is followed by the outer liquid core, which extends into the depths for another 2260 kilometers.
            This layer is also mobile and is capable of emitting electric currents, which create the planet's magnetic
            field!
            At the very center of the Earth is the inner core. It is very hard and contains a lot of iron.

            <span class="text-info h3">EARTH SATELLITE</span><br>
            The planet Earth has its only satellite - the Moon. The first to describe the properties and characteristics
            of the moon was the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, he described the mountains, craters and plains on
            the surface of the moon, and in 1651 the astronomer Giovanni Riccioli wrote a map of the visible side of the
            lunar surface. In the 20th century, on February 3, 1966, the Luna-9 descent module landed on the Moon for
            the first time, and a few years later, on July 21, 1969, a human foot set foot on the Moon for the first
            time.
            The moon is always turned to the planet Earth with only one of its sides. On this visible side of the Moon,
            flat "seas", chains of mountains and multiple craters of various sizes are visible. The other side,
            invisible from the Earth, has on the surface a large cluster of mountains and even more craters, and the
            light reflecting from the Moon, thanks to which we can see it at night in a pale lunar color, is weakly
            reflected rays from the Sun.
            The planet Earth and its satellite the Moon are very different in many properties, while the ratio of stable
            oxygen isotopes for the planet Earth and its satellite the Moon is the same. Conducted radiometric studies
            have shown that the age of both celestial bodies is the same, approximately 4.5 billion years. These data
            give rise to the assumption that the Moon and the Earth originated from the same substance, which gives rise
            to several interesting hypotheses about the origin of the Moon: from the origin from the same protoplanetary
            cloud, the capture of the Moon by the Earth, and to the formation of the Moon from the collision of the
            Earth with a large object.
