        <span class="text-info h3">Earth's atmosphere</span> <br />
        The Earth's atmosphere mainly consists of nitrogen (78.08%), oxygen
        (20.95%), argon (0.93%) and carbon dioxide (0.04%), also depending on
        the climate, it can include 0.1 up to 1.5% water vapor. The average
        atmospheric pressure on Earth (at sea level) is 1 atmosphere (101.325
        kPa). Three-quarters of the mass of the atmosphere is contained in the
        first 11 kilometers from the Earth's surface. The earth's atmosphere has
        no definite boundaries; it gradually becomes thinner and rarer, passing
        into outer space. The Earth's atmosphere is conditionally divided into
        layers that differ in density, temperature and composition: troposphere,
        stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, exosphere. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span class="text-info h3">Earth's climate</span> <br />
        The climate on our planet is seasonal due to the angle of inclination of
        the axis of 23.44 degrees. The amount of solar energy reaching the
        Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. The earth is divided
        into climatic zones - natural zones that have an approximately uniform
        climate. In the Köppen classification system, the criterion for
        determining the type of climate is what plants grow in a given area. The
        system includes five main climatic zones (moist tropical forests,
        deserts, temperate zone, continental climate and polar type), which, in
        turn, are divided into more specific subtypes. The water cycle in nature
        is vital for the existence of life on land. Sea currents are an
        important factor in the formation of the Earth's climate, as is the
        thermohaline circulation, which is created due to a difference in water
        density and transfers thermal energy from the equatorial regions to the
        polar regions. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span class="text-info h3">landform</span> <br />
        Approximately 70.8% of the planet's surface is occupied by the oceans.
        On the continents there are rivers, lakes, groundwater and ice, together
        with the World Ocean they make up the hydrosphere. The underwater
        surface is mountainous, includes a system of mid-ocean ridges, as well
        as underwater volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic
        plateaus and abyssal plains. On land, mountains, deserts, plains,
        plateaus and other types of relief are distinguished. The Earth's poles
        are covered in an ice shell that includes the Arctic sea ice and the
        Antarctic ice sheet. Interesting Earth Facts Earth is the most explored
        planet in the solar system and the only habitable planet known to
        science. Earth is the densest planet in the solar system. Earth formed
        from the solar nebula about 4.5 billion years ago. The gravitational
        influence of the Moon on the Earth is the cause of ocean tides. The
        Earth is inhabited by about 8.7 million species of living beings, and
        man is one of them. The surface of the planet was constantly changing:
        continents appeared and collapsed, moved along the surface, either
        gathering into a supercontinent, or diverging into isolated continents.
        The fall of asteroids with a diameter of several thousand kilometers to
        the Earth poses a danger of its destruction, but all the observed bodies
        are too small for this and dangerous only for the biosphere. The Earth
        was first photographed from space in 1959 by the Explorer 6 spacecraft.
        The first person to see the Earth from space was Yuri Gagarin in 1961.
        From outer space and from planets located beyond the orbit of the Earth,
        one can observe the passage of our planet through phases similar to
        those of the moon. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span class="text-info h3">The internal structure of the earth</span>
        <br />
        Of the planets of its group, the Earth has the largest mass and
        therefore has the largest internal energy - gravitational and
        radiogenic, under the influence of which processes in the earth's crust
        are still ongoing, as can be seen from volcanic and tectonic activity.
        Although igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks have already formed,
        forming the outlines of landscapes, which are gradually modified under
        the influence of erosion. Under the atmosphere of our planet is a solid
        surface called the earth's crust. It is divided into huge pieces (slabs)
        of solid rock, which can move and, when moving, touch and push each
        other. As a result of this movement, mountains and other features of the
        earth's surface appear. The earth's crust is 10 to 50 kilometers thick.
        The crust "floats" on the liquid earth's mantle, the mass of which is
        67% of the mass of the entire Earth and extends to a depth of 2890
        kilometers! The mantle is followed by the outer liquid core, which
        extends into the depths for another 2260 kilometers. This layer is also
        mobile and is capable of emitting electric currents, which create the
        planet's magnetic field! At the very center of the Earth is the inner
        core. It is very hard and contains a lot of iron. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span class="text-info h3">EARTH SATELLITE</span><br />
        The planet Earth has its only satellite - the Moon. The first to
        describe the properties and characteristics of the moon was the Italian
        astronomer Galileo Galilei, he described the mountains, craters and
        plains on the surface of the moon, and in 1651 the astronomer Giovanni
        Riccioli wrote a map of the visible side of the lunar surface. In the
        20th century, on February 3, 1966, the Luna-9 descent module landed on
        the Moon for the first time, and a few years later, on July 21, 1969, a
        human foot set foot on the Moon for the first time. The moon is always
        turned to the planet Earth with only one of its sides. On this visible
        side of the Moon, flat "seas", chains of mountains and multiple craters
        of various sizes are visible. The other side, invisible from the Earth,
        has on the surface a large cluster of mountains and even more craters,
        and the light reflecting from the Moon, thanks to which we can see it at
        night in a pale lunar color, is weakly reflected rays from the Sun. The
        planet Earth and its satellite the Moon are very different in many
        properties, while the ratio of stable oxygen isotopes for the planet
        Earth and its satellite the Moon is the same. Conducted radiometric
        studies have shown that the age of both celestial bodies is the same,
        approximately 4.5 billion years. These data give rise to the assumption
        that the Moon and the Earth originated from the same substance, which
        gives rise to several interesting hypotheses about the origin of the
        Moon: from the origin from the same protoplanetary cloud, the capture of
        the Moon by the Earth, and to the formation of the Moon from the
        collision of the Earth with a large object.
