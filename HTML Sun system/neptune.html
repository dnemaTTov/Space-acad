          <br />
          Neptune is the eighth and last planet by distance from the Sun (the
          eighth planet of the Solar System). Neptune refers to the ice giants
          and is named after the Roman god of the seas Neptune. Neptune
          currently has 14 natural satellites. Neptune's neighbor is Uranus.
          Beyond Neptune begins the region of trans–Neptunian objects (TNOs) -
          the Kuiper Belt. Just like the gas giants of the Solar System, Neptune
          has a magnetosphere. The standard model of Neptune assumes that its
          structure includes an upper atmosphere; an atmosphere consisting of
          hydrogen, helium and methane; a mantle of water, ammonia and methane
          ice; a stone-ice core. Neptune has a system of rings of a reddish hue,
          consisting of 5 components.

          <span class="text-info h3">Neptune's Orbit</span> <br />
          The average distance from Neptune to the Sun is 4.55 billion
          kilometers (30.1 astronomical units). Perihelion (the closest point of
          the orbit to the Sun): 4,452 billion kilometers (29,766 astronomical
          units). Aphelion (the farthest point of the orbit from the Sun): 4,554
          billion kilometers (30,441 astronomical units). The average speed of
          Neptune's orbit is about 5.4349 kilometers per second. The planet
          makes one revolution around the Sun in about 165 Earth years. A year
          on the planet is 367.49 Neptunian days. The distance from Neptune to
          Earth varies from 4.3 to 4.6 billion kilometers.

          <br />
          Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the Solar System and the third
          by mass. The temperature of Neptune in the upper atmosphere is close
          to -220 °C, and in the center it can reach 7000 °C, which is
          comparable to the surface of the Sun. The average radius of Neptune is
          24,622 ± 19 kilometers, that is, slightly less than 4 radii of the
          Earth. The surface area of Neptune is 7.6408 billion square
          kilometers. The average density of Neptune is 1,638 grams per cubic
          centimeter. The acceleration of gravity on Neptune is 11.15 meters per
          second squared (1.14 g). The mass of Neptune is equal to 1,0243 x
          1,026 kilograms, which is 17,147 Earth masses. Neptune's magnetic
          field is tilted by 47 relative to the axis of rotation of the planet.

          <span class="text-info h3">Neptune's Atmosphere</span> <br />
          Neptune's atmosphere is conventionally divided into 2 main regions:
          the troposphere, where the temperature decreases with altitude, and
          the stratosphere, where the temperature increases with altitude, on
          the contrary. The main components of Neptune's atmosphere are hydrogen
          (about 80 ± 3.2%), helium (19 ± 3.2%) and methane (1.5 ± 0.5%). The
          strongest winds among the planets of the Solar System are raging in
          the atmosphere of Neptune, according to some estimates, their speeds
          can reach 2100 kilometers per hour. The weather on Neptune is
          characterized by an extremely dynamic system of storms, with winds
          reaching almost supersonic speeds.

          <span class="text-info h3"> Neptune Exploration</span> <br />
          Studying the orbit of Uranus helped astronomers discover Neptune.
          French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace calculated the orbit of Uranus
          in 1783, but over time differences between the predicted and observed
          position of the planet were discovered. Astronomers have suggested
          that some cosmic body interferes with the movement of the ice giant.
          Thanks to this assumption, they were able to determine the distance
          from the Sun to an unknown object and its approximate mass, and
          subsequently discovered Neptune. Tilt of the rotation axis Uranus
          rotates at an angle of 97.77 °, that is, the axis of rotation of
          Uranus is almost parallel to the plane of its orbit. This is the most
          unusual axis of rotation among all the planets of the Solar System;
          for comparison, Neptune, which is next door, rotates at an angle of
          28.5 ° As a result, at the solstices on this planet, one of the poles
          of Uranus is always directed at the Sun. Each pole of Uranus has been
          in darkness for 42 Earth years and has been illuminated by the Sun for
          another 42 years. At the same time, at the moments of the equinoxes,
          the Sun faces the equator of the planet, which leads to the “usual”
          change of day and night — similar to that on other planets. It is not
          yet known why Uranus has such an unusual tilt of the axis of rotation.
          Scientists believe that this giant planet “turned on its side” 3-4
          billion years ago due to one or more collisions with another space
          object. By the way, the same collision could lead to an unusual
          rotation of Uranus. The ice giant (like Venus) rotates clockwise,
          while the other planets of the Solar System rotate counterclockwise,
          that is, in the same direction as the Sun. Discovered on September 23,
          1846, Neptune became the first planet discovered by mathematical
          calculations, rather than by regular observations. The only visit in
          the history of cosmonautics to the vicinity of Neptune on August 25,
          1989, was made by the American Voyager 2 spacecraft. Observations of
          Neptune in the radio wave range show that the planet is a source of
          continuous radiation and irregular flashes.
