            Neptune is the eighth and last planet by distance from the Sun (the eighth planet of the Solar System).
            Neptune refers to the ice giants and is named after the Roman god of the seas Neptune.
            Neptune currently has 14 natural satellites.
            Neptune's neighbor is Uranus.
            Beyond Neptune begins the region of trans–Neptunian objects (TNOs) - the Kuiper Belt.
            Just like the gas giants of the Solar System, Neptune has a magnetosphere.
            The standard model of Neptune assumes that its structure includes an upper atmosphere; an atmosphere
            consisting of hydrogen, helium and methane; a mantle of water, ammonia and methane ice; a stone-ice core.
            Neptune has a system of rings of a reddish hue, consisting of 5 components.

            The average distance from Neptune to the Sun is 4.55 billion kilometers (30.1 astronomical units).
            Perihelion (the closest point of the orbit to the Sun): 4,452 billion kilometers (29,766 astronomical
            units).
            Aphelion (the farthest point of the orbit from the Sun): 4,554 billion kilometers (30,441 astronomical
            units).
            The average speed of Neptune's orbit is about 5.4349 kilometers per second.
            The planet makes one revolution around the Sun in about 165 Earth years.
            A year on the planet is 367.49 Neptunian days.
            The distance from Neptune to Earth varies from 4.3 to 4.6 billion kilometers.

            Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the Solar System and the third by mass.
            The temperature of Neptune in the upper atmosphere is close to -220 °C, and in the center it can reach 7000
            °C, which is comparable to the surface of the Sun.
            The average radius of Neptune is 24,622 ± 19 kilometers, that is, slightly less than 4 radii of the Earth.
            The surface area of Neptune is 7.6408 billion square kilometers.
            The average density of Neptune is 1,638 grams per cubic centimeter.
            The acceleration of gravity on Neptune is 11.15 meters per second squared (1.14 g).
            The mass of Neptune is equal to 1,0243 x 1,026 kilograms, which is 17,147 Earth masses.
            Neptune's magnetic field is tilted by 47 relative to the axis of rotation of the planet.

            <span class="text-info h3">Neptune's Atmosphere</span> <br>
            Neptune's atmosphere is conventionally divided into 2 main regions: the troposphere, where the temperature
            decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where the temperature increases with altitude, on the
            contrary.
            The main components of Neptune's atmosphere are hydrogen (about 80 ± 3.2%), helium (19 ± 3.2%) and methane
            (1.5 ± 0.5%).
            The strongest winds among the planets of the Solar System are raging in the atmosphere of Neptune, according
            to some estimates, their speeds can reach 2100 kilometers per hour.
            The weather on Neptune is characterized by an extremely dynamic system of storms, with winds reaching almost
            supersonic speeds.

            Studying the orbit of Uranus helped astronomers discover Neptune. French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace
            calculated the orbit of Uranus in 1783, but over time differences between the predicted and observed
            position of the planet were discovered. Astronomers have suggested that some cosmic body interferes with the
            movement of the ice giant. Thanks to this assumption, they were able to determine the distance from the Sun
            to an unknown object and its approximate mass, and subsequently discovered Neptune.
            Tilt of the rotation axis
            Uranus rotates at an angle of 97.77 °, that is, the axis of rotation of Uranus is almost parallel to the
            plane of its orbit. This is the most unusual axis of rotation among all the planets of the Solar System; for
            comparison, Neptune, which is next door, rotates at an angle of 28.5 °
            As a result, at the solstices on this planet, one of the poles of Uranus is always directed at the Sun. Each
            pole of Uranus has been in darkness for 42 Earth years and has been illuminated by the Sun for another 42
            years. At the same time, at the moments of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of the planet, which
            leads to the “usual” change of day and night — similar to that on other planets.
            It is not yet known why Uranus has such an unusual tilt of the axis of rotation. Scientists believe that
            this giant planet “turned on its side” 3-4 billion years ago due to one or more collisions with another
            space object. By the way, the same collision could lead to an unusual rotation of Uranus. The ice giant
            (like Venus) rotates clockwise, while the other planets of the Solar System rotate counterclockwise, that
            is, in the same direction as the Sun.
            Discovered on September 23, 1846, Neptune became the first planet discovered by mathematical calculations,
            rather than by regular observations.
            The only visit in the history of cosmonautics to the vicinity of Neptune on August 25, 1989, was made by the
            American Voyager 2 spacecraft.
            Observations of Neptune in the radio wave range show that the planet is a source of continuous radiation and
            irregular flashes.
