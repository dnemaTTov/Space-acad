          The sun - the central body of the solar system - is a hot ball of gas.
          It is 750 times more massive than all other bodies in the solar system
          combined. That is why everything in the solar system can be roughly
          considered to revolve around the sun. The sun outweighs the earth
          330,000 times. A chain of 109 planets like ours could be placed on the
          solar diameter. The sun is the closest star to the Earth, it is the
          only star whose visible disk is visible to the naked eye. All other
          stars that are light years away from us, even when viewed through
          powerful telescopes, do not reveal any details of their surfaces.
          Light from the Sun reaches us in 8 and a third minutes. According to
          one of the hypotheses, it was together with the Sun that our planetary
          system, the Earth, and then life on it, formed. The sun rushes in the
          direction of the constellation Hercules in an orbit around the center
          of our Galaxy, overcoming more than 200 km every second. The Sun and
          the center of the Galaxy are separated by an abyss of 25,000 light
          years. The same path runs from the Sun to the outskirts of the Galaxy.
          Our star is located near the galactic plane, not far from the border
          of one of the spiral arms. Therefore, walking in the park and
          leisurely leaving 3 km per hour behind us, we simultaneously rotate
          along with the surface of our planet around the earth's axis at a
          speed of 23 km per minute at the latitude of Moscow, rotate with the
          Earth around the Sun, leaving 30 km behind every second, and Finally,
          at a speed of 230 km per second, we surf the expanses of our Galaxy.
          We save the reader from listing the movements of the latter.

          <span class="text-info h3">FATE OF THE SUN</span> <br />
          Like all stars, the Sun was born in a compressed gas and dust nebula.
          When such a grandiose mass (2.1030 kg) was compressed, it heated
          itself strongly by internal pressure to temperatures at which
          thermonuclear reactions could begin in its center. So a newborn star
          was lit (do not confuse with new stars). In the central part, the
          temperature on the Sun is 15,000,000 K, and the pressure reaches
          hundreds of billions of atmospheres. Basically, three-quarters, the
          Sun at the beginning of its life consisted of hydrogen. It is hydrogen
          that in the course of thermonuclear reactions turns into helium, while
          the energy emitted by the Sun is released. The sun belongs to a type
          of star called a yellow dwarf. It is a main sequence star and belongs
          to the spectral type G2. The mass of a lone star always determines its
          fate. During its lifetime (5 billion years), in the center of our
          star, where the temperature is quite high, about half of all the
          hydrogen available there burned out. The sun has about the same life
          left, 5 billion years. After the hydrogen in the center of the star is
          running out, the Sun will increase in size, it will become a red
          giant. This will have a profound effect on the Earth: the temperature
          will rise, the oceans will boil away, life will become impossible in
          the form we know it now. Our star will end its life as a white dwarf,
          delighting future extraterrestrial astronomers unknown to us with a
          new planetary nebula, the shape of which may turn out to be very
          bizarre due to the influence of the planets.

          <span class="text-info h3">PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUN</span>
          <br />
          The size of the Sun (1,392,000 km in diameter) is very large by Earth
          standards, but astronomers, at the same time, call it a yellow dwarf -
          in the world of stars, the Sun, at first glance, does not stand out
          with anything special. However, in recent years, there are more and
          more arguments in favor of some unusualness of our Sun. In particular,
          the Sun emits less ultraviolet radiation than other stars of the same
          type. The sun has more mass than similar stars. In addition, these
          very similar stars to the Sun are seen in inconstancy, they change
          their brightness, that is, they are variable stars. The sun does not
          noticeably change its brightness, although it is also referred to as
          variable stars: Have you heard about the eleven-year cycle of the
          Sun's activity? However, some uniqueness of the Sun is not a reason
          for pride, but a basis for more detailed studies. The radiation power
          of the Sun is 3.8.1020 MW. Only about one-half of a billionth of the
          Sun's total energy reaches Earth. Imagine a natural disaster in which
          fifteen standard apartments of 45 square meters. m. was not lucky
          enough to be flooded to the ceiling with water. If this amount of
          water is the entire power of the Sun's radiation, then the Earth will
          have less than a teaspoon. But it is thanks to this energy that the
          water cycle occurs on Earth, winds blow, life has developed and is
          developing. All the energy hidden in fossil fuels (oil, coal, peat,
          gas) was also originally radiated by the Sun. The Sun radiates its
          energy in all wavelengths. But not evenly. 48% of the radiation energy
          is in the visible region of the spectrum, with the maximum
          corresponding to the yellow-green color. About 45% of the energy lost
          by the Sun is carried away by infrared rays. As you can see, gamma
          rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and radio radiation account for only 8%.
          However, the radiation of the sun is so strong, coupled with various
