            The sun - the central body of the solar system - is a hot ball of gas. It is 750 times more massive than all
            other bodies in the solar system combined. That is why everything in the solar system can be roughly
            considered to revolve around the sun. The sun outweighs the earth 330,000 times. A chain of 109 planets like
            ours could be placed on the solar diameter. The sun is the closest star to the Earth, it is the only star
            whose visible disk is visible to the naked eye. All other stars that are light years away from us, even when
            viewed through powerful telescopes, do not reveal any details of their surfaces. Light from the Sun reaches
            us in 8 and a third minutes. According to one of the hypotheses, it was together with the Sun that our
            planetary system, the Earth, and then life on it, formed.
            The sun rushes in the direction of the constellation Hercules in an orbit around the center of our Galaxy,
            overcoming more than 200 km every second. The Sun and the center of the Galaxy are separated by an abyss of
            25,000 light years. The same path runs from the Sun to the outskirts of the Galaxy. Our star is located near
            the galactic plane, not far from the border of one of the spiral arms. Therefore, walking in the park and
            leisurely leaving 3 km per hour behind us, we simultaneously rotate along with the surface of our planet
            around the earth's axis at a speed of 23 km per minute at the latitude of Moscow, rotate with the Earth
            around the Sun, leaving 30 km behind every second, and Finally, at a speed of 230 km per second, we surf the
            expanses of our Galaxy. We save the reader from listing the movements of the latter.

            <span class="text-info h3">FATE OF THE SUN</span> <br>
            Like all stars, the Sun was born in a compressed gas and dust nebula. When such a grandiose mass (2.1030 kg)
            was compressed, it heated itself strongly by internal pressure to temperatures at which thermonuclear
            reactions could begin in its center. So a newborn star was lit (do not confuse with new stars). In the
            central part, the temperature on the Sun is 15,000,000 K, and the pressure reaches hundreds of billions of
            atmospheres.
            Basically, three-quarters, the Sun at the beginning of its life consisted of hydrogen. It is hydrogen that
            in the course of thermonuclear reactions turns into helium, while the energy emitted by the Sun is released.
            The sun belongs to a type of star called a yellow dwarf. It is a main sequence star and belongs to the
            spectral type G2. The mass of a lone star always determines its fate. During its lifetime (5 billion years),
            in the center of our star, where the temperature is quite high, about half of all the hydrogen available
            there burned out. The sun has about the same life left, 5 billion years.
            After the hydrogen in the center of the star is running out, the Sun will increase in size, it will become a
            red giant. This will have a profound effect on the Earth: the temperature will rise, the oceans will boil
            away, life will become impossible in the form we know it now. Our star will end its life as a white dwarf,
            delighting future extraterrestrial astronomers unknown to us with a new planetary nebula, the shape of which
            may turn out to be very bizarre due to the influence of the planets.

            The size of the Sun (1,392,000 km in diameter) is very large by Earth standards, but astronomers, at the
            same time, call it a yellow dwarf - in the world of stars, the Sun, at first glance, does not stand out with
            anything special. However, in recent years, there are more and more arguments in favor of some unusualness
            of our Sun. In particular, the Sun emits less ultraviolet radiation than other stars of the same type. The
            sun has more mass than similar stars. In addition, these very similar stars to the Sun are seen in
            inconstancy, they change their brightness, that is, they are variable stars. The sun does not noticeably
            change its brightness, although it is also referred to as variable stars: Have you heard about the
            eleven-year cycle of the Sun's activity?
            However, some uniqueness of the Sun is not a reason for pride, but a basis for more detailed studies.
            The radiation power of the Sun is 3.8.1020 MW. Only about one-half of a billionth of the Sun's total energy
            reaches Earth. Imagine a natural disaster in which fifteen standard apartments of 45 square meters. m. was
            not lucky enough to be flooded to the ceiling with water. If this amount of water is the entire power of the
            Sun's radiation, then the Earth will have less than a teaspoon. But it is thanks to this energy that the
            water cycle occurs on Earth, winds blow, life has developed and is developing. All the energy hidden in
            fossil fuels (oil, coal, peat, gas) was also originally radiated by the Sun. The Sun radiates its energy in
            all wavelengths. But not evenly. 48% of the radiation energy is in the visible region of the spectrum, with
            the maximum corresponding to the yellow-green color. About 45% of the energy lost by the Sun is carried away
            by infrared rays. As you can see, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and radio radiation account for only 8%.
            However, the radiation of the sun is so strong, coupled with various
