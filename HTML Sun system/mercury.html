            Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. It is 18 times lighter than the Earth, and its diameter
            is barely two-fifths the size of the Earth. To better imagine the size of Mercury, let's compare it with the
            Moon - Mercury is only a third larger than our natural satellite.
            The already small planet has become even smaller over time. The core of the planet has cooled down, due to
            which the radius of Mercury has decreased by about 5-10 kilometers.

            <span class="text-info h3">Mercury is a hot planet?</span> <br>
            The temperature on the surface of Mercury fluctuates more than on any other planet in the solar system: from
            -173 ° C at night to 427 ° C during the day. This is due to the fact that the smallest planet has virtually
            no atmosphere to store heat, so Mercury is rapidly losing energy stored from the Sun.
            Although Mercury is closer to the Sun than other planets, it is not the hottest planet. In fact, the hottest
            planet is Venus.
            How long is one day on Mercury?
            A solar day - the amount of time it takes for the sun to rise, set, and rise again in the same place - on
            Mercury lasts approximately 176 Earth days. And here is another unusual fact: one year on this planet lasts
            only 88 Earth days, that is, almost two times shorter than one Mercury day. Why is this happening?
            The smallest planet slowly rotates around its axis - one revolution takes 59 Earth days (one sidereal day).
            However, sunrises and sunsets on this planet are significantly different from those on Earth. Due to the
            planet's elongated orbit, the Sun rises (and sets) twice on Mercury. Thus, the Sun takes longer to reappear
            in the same place, and one solar day lasts twice as long as one year.
            Despite the fact that Mercury rotates slowly around its axis, it rapidly rushes along its orbit around the
            Sun - at a speed of 47 km / s. For comparison, the second fastest planet in the solar system, Venus, is
            moving at a speed of 35 km/s.

            <span class="text-info h3">What is Mercury made of?</span> <br>
            Since Mercury belongs to the group of terrestrial planets, it is mainly composed of iron, nickel and
            silicates. Most of the volume of Mercury - about 61% - is occupied by a huge iron core, about the size of
            our moon. For comparison, the Earth's core is only 16% of its volume. The core of the planet is surrounded
            by a mantle about 400 kilometers thick. The surface of Mercury also resembles that of the moon - it is
            stony, hard and densely covered with craters.
            Craters appear from collisions with asteroids or other space objects; the more craters on the planet, the
            older it is. The presence on Mercury of such a number of craters indicates its solid age.
            What is Mercury retrograde?
            Mercury is called retrograde when, for observers from Earth, it begins to move in the "reverse" direction.
            In fact, the planet does not change the direction of its movement, it's just an optical illusion. You can
            learn more about retrograde movement in one of our previous articles.
            The small fast planet moves in the "reverse" direction three or four times a year for three weeks. In 2022,
            Mercury retrograde will be visible from May 10 to June 3, September 9 to October 2, and December 29 to
            January 18, 2023.
