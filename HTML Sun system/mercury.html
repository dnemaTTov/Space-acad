          <span class="text-info h3">Smallest planet</span> <br />
          Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. It is 18 times
          lighter than the Earth, and its diameter is barely two-fifths the size
          of the Earth. To better imagine the size of Mercury, let's compare it
          with the Moon - Mercury is only a third larger than our natural
          satellite. The already small planet has become even smaller over time.
          The core of the planet has cooled down, due to which the radius of
          Mercury has decreased by about 5-10 kilometers.

          <span class="text-info h3">Mercury is a hot planet?</span> <br />
          The temperature on the surface of Mercury fluctuates more than on any
          other planet in the solar system: from -173 ° C at night to 427 ° C
          during the day. This is due to the fact that the smallest planet has
          virtually no atmosphere to store heat, so Mercury is rapidly losing
          energy stored from the Sun. Although Mercury is closer to the Sun than
          other planets, it is not the hottest planet. In fact, the hottest
          planet is Venus. How long is one day on Mercury? A solar day - the
          amount of time it takes for the sun to rise, set, and rise again in
          the same place - on Mercury lasts approximately 176 Earth days. And
          here is another unusual fact: one year on this planet lasts only 88
          Earth days, that is, almost two times shorter than one Mercury day.
          Why is this happening? The smallest planet slowly rotates around its
          axis - one revolution takes 59 Earth days (one sidereal day). However,
          sunrises and sunsets on this planet are significantly different from
          those on Earth. Due to the planet's elongated orbit, the Sun rises
          (and sets) twice on Mercury. Thus, the Sun takes longer to reappear in
          the same place, and one solar day lasts twice as long as one year.
          Despite the fact that Mercury rotates slowly around its axis, it
          rapidly rushes along its orbit around the Sun - at a speed of 47 km /
          s. For comparison, the second fastest planet in the solar system,
          Venus, is moving at a speed of 35 km/s.

          <span class="text-info h3">What is Mercury made of?</span> <br />
          Since Mercury belongs to the group of terrestrial planets, it is
          mainly composed of iron, nickel and silicates. Most of the volume of
          Mercury - about 61% - is occupied by a huge iron core, about the size
          of our moon. For comparison, the Earth's core is only 16% of its
          volume. The core of the planet is surrounded by a mantle about 400
          kilometers thick. The surface of Mercury also resembles that of the
          moon - it is stony, hard and densely covered with craters. Craters
          appear from collisions with asteroids or other space objects; the more
          craters on the planet, the older it is. The presence on Mercury of
          such a number of craters indicates its solid age. What is Mercury
          retrograde? Mercury is called retrograde when, for observers from
          Earth, it begins to move in the "reverse" direction. In fact, the
          planet does not change the direction of its movement, it's just an
          optical illusion. You can learn more about retrograde movement in one
          of our previous articles. The small fast planet moves in the "reverse"
          direction three or four times a year for three weeks. In 2022, Mercury
          retrograde will be visible from May 10 to June 3, September 9 to
          October 2, and December 29 to January 18, 2023.
