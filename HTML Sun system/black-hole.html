          Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape
          were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and
          Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first
          modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black
          hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation
          of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape.
          Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not
          until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic
          prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by
          Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally
          collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The
          first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several
          researchers independently in 1971. Black holes of stellar mass form
          when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a
          black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its
          surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses
          (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black
          holes. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the
          centres of most galaxies.

          <span class="text-info h3">Theory about Black-holes</span>
          <br />
          The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction
          with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible
          light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external
          accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the
          brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a
          supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very
          brightly before being "swallowed." If other stars are orbiting a black
          hole, their orbits can determine the black hole's mass and location.
          Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as
          neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous
          stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that
          the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way
          galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar
          masses.

          <br />
          On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
          collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational
          waves, representing the first observation of a black hole merger. On
          10 April 2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity
          was published, following observations made by the Event Horizon
          Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87's
          galactic centre. As of 2021, the nearest known body thought to be a
          black hole is around 1,500 light-years (460 parsecs) away (see list of
          nearest black holes). Though only a couple dozen black holes have been
          found so far in the Milky Way, there are thought to be hundreds of
          millions, most of which are solitary and do not cause emission of
          radiation. Therefore, they would only be detectable by gravitational
          lensing.

          >
          The no-hair theorem postulates that, once it achieves a stable
          condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent
          physical properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum; the
          black hole is otherwise featureless. If the conjecture is true, any
          two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or
          parameters, are indistinguishable from one another. The degree to
          which the conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of
          modern physics is currently an unsolved problem.[51] These properties
          are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For
          example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any
          other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere
          containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog
          of Gauss's law (through the ADM mass), far away from the black
          hole.[65] Likewise, the angular momentum (or spin) can be measured
          from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field,
          through for example the Lense–Thirring effect.
