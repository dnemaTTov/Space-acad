            Saturn, with a radius of 58,232 km, is the second largest planet in our solar system - only the other gas
            giant, Jupiter, is larger than it. To make a trip along the planet's equator, you need to cover a distance
            of 365,882 kilometers!
            How many times larger is Saturn than Earth?
            The radius of Saturn is about 9.5 times the radius of our planet; in addition, the gas giant is almost 95
            times more massive. To better understand the size of Saturn, imagine that 764 planets like Earth could fit
            inside it.

            <span class="text-info h3">Orbit and rotation of Saturn</span> <br>
            Each planet in the solar system takes a certain amount of time to complete one revolution around the sun and
            one revolution around its axis. On Earth, these periods last 365.25 days and 24 hours, respectively, but
            things are different on Saturn.
            How long is a day on Saturn?
            Saturn rotates once on its axis in just 10 hours and 32 minutes, making it the second shortest day among the
            planets in our solar system. Only Jupiter rotates faster. Due to the high speed of rotation, Saturn is
            flattened at the poles and expands towards the equator.
            How long is a year on Saturn?
            Like Jupiter, Saturn rotates very quickly on its axis, but it takes a long time for it to complete one
            rotation.
            around the sun. The speed with which Saturn revolves around the star is small: one year on the planet lasts
            29.4571 Earth years or 10,759 Earth days.

            How far away is Saturn?
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. Billions of kilometers separate it from the Sun and the Earth.
            How far is Saturn from the Sun?
            The planet revolves around the Sun at a distance of about 9.5 AU. - this is 9.5 times the distance between
            the Earth and our star. It is equivalent to 1.486 billion kilometers.

            <span class="text-info h3">How far is Saturn from Earth?</span> <br>
            As Saturn and Earth travel in their orbits, the distance between them is constantly changing. During closest
            approach, celestial bodies are approximately 1.195 billion kilometers apart; when Saturn and Earth are at
            their most distant from each other, the distance between them is about 1.66 billion kilometers.

            <span class="text-info h3"> How long does it take to get to Saturn?</span> <br>
            The duration of the flight to Saturn is determined by two factors: the route chosen for the mission and the
            speed of the spacecraft. For example, the Voyager 1 mission reached Saturn in 3 years and 2 months, and the
            Cassini spacecraft in 6 years and 9 months.

            Titan is an unusual celestial body: it is the only moon in the entire solar system with a dense atmosphere
            similar to Earth, and the only place, with the exception of the Earth, on the surface of which there is
            liquid. Since the surface of Titan is very cold, there is no liquid water; however, the temperature is
            suitable for liquid methane and ethane. What's more, evidence has been found of an ocean beneath the moon's
            surface, where conditions are potentially habitable.
