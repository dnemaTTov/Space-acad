          People observed Uranus even before William Herschel, who is considered
          the discoverer of this planet, but usually took it for a star. In 128
          BC, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus added Uranus to his catalog of
          stars; centuries later, in 1690, the astronomer from England John
          Flamsteed made the same mistake and registered Uranus as a star 34 in
          the constellation Taurus. William Herschel was also unable to
          determine the nature of the object he found, but it was Herschel's
          observations on March 13, 1781 that led to the recognition of Uranus
          as a planet. While Herschel described the object he found as a comet,
          other astronomers, noticing its movement across the sky, suspected
          that this object was a new planet. By 1783, Herschel himself
          recognized that the “comet" he found was actually a planet.

          Uranus is considered a giant planet. If the Earth was the size of a
          big apple, then Uranus would be the size of a basketball. However, to
          observers from Earth, the ice giant does not look big: its apparent
          size varies from 3.3" to 4.1", while the apparent size of Mercury (the
          smallest planet in the Solar System) ranges from 4.5" to 13".

          <span class="text-info h3">The size of Uranium</span> <br />
          Uranus is the third largest and fourth most massive planet in the
          Solar System. The radius of the pale blue planet is slightly larger
          than the radius of Neptune: 25,362 km versus 24,622 km, respectively.
          The size of Uranus in relation to the Earth The volume of Uranium is
          63 times larger than the volume of the Earth: 63 terrestrial spheres
          can fit inside this planet! In addition, the ice giant is about 4
          times wider than the Earth. To better understand the size of Uranus,
          take a look at the NASA image, which shows the sizes of all the
          planets relative to each other.

          <span class="text-info h3"> The orbit and rotation of Uranus?</span>
          <br />
          Studying the orbit of Uranus helped astronomers discover Neptune.
          French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace calculated the orbit of Uranus
          in 1783, but over time differences between the predicted and observed
          position of the planet were discovered. Astronomers have suggested
          that some cosmic body interferes with the movement of the ice giant.
          Thanks to this assumption, they were able to determine the distance
          from the Sun to an unknown object and its approximate mass, and
          subsequently discovered Neptune. Tilt of the rotation axis Uranus
          rotates at an angle of 97.77 °, that is, the axis of rotation of
          Uranus is almost parallel to the plane of its orbit. This is the most
          unusual axis of rotation among all the planets of the Solar System;
          for comparison, Neptune, which is next door, rotates at an angle of
          28.5 ° As a result, at the solstices on this planet, one of the poles
          of Uranus is always directed at the Sun. Each pole of Uranus has been
          in darkness for 42 Earth years and has been illuminated by the Sun for
          another 42 years. At the same time, at the moments of the equinoxes,
          the Sun faces the equator of the planet, which leads to the “usual”
          change of day and night — similar to that on other planets. It is not
          yet known why Uranus has such an unusual tilt of the axis of rotation.
          Scientists believe that this giant planet “turned on its side” 3-4
          billion years ago due to one or more collisions with another space
          object. By the way, the same collision could lead to an unusual
          rotation of Uranus. The ice giant (like Venus) rotates clockwise,
          while the other planets of the Solar System rotate counterclockwise,
          that is, in the same direction as the Sun.

          <span class="text-info h3">How long does a year last on Uranus?</span>
          <br />
          Uranus takes 84 Earth years to complete one revolution around the Sun.
          In 2033, the ice giant will make the third complete revolution around
          our star since the discovery of the planet in 1781. Due to the
          distance of the planet from the Sun, the stellar and solar days on
          Uranus are almost equal — the first last 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24
          seconds, and the second for a second less. The duration of one year on
          Uranus is 42,718 Uranian solar days.
