            People observed Uranus even before William Herschel, who is considered the discoverer of this planet, but
            usually took it for a star. In 128 BC, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus added Uranus to his catalog of stars;
            centuries later, in 1690, the astronomer from England John Flamsteed made the same mistake and registered
            Uranus as a star 34 in the constellation Taurus.
            William Herschel was also unable to determine the nature of the object he found, but it was Herschel's
            observations on March 13, 1781 that led to the recognition of Uranus as a planet. While Herschel described
            the object he found as a comet, other astronomers, noticing its movement across the sky, suspected that this
            object was a new planet. By 1783, Herschel himself recognized that the “comet" he found was actually a
            planet.

            Uranus is considered a giant planet. If the Earth was the size of a big apple, then Uranus would be the size
            of a basketball. However, to observers from Earth, the ice giant does not look big: its apparent size varies
            from 3.3" to 4.1", while the apparent size of Mercury (the smallest planet in the Solar System) ranges from
            4.5" to 13".

            <span class="text-info h3">The size of Uranium</span> <br>
            Uranus is the third largest and fourth most massive planet in the Solar System. The radius of the pale blue
            planet is slightly larger than the radius of Neptune: 25,362 km versus 24,622 km, respectively.
            The size of Uranus in relation to the Earth
            The volume of Uranium is 63 times larger than the volume of the Earth: 63 terrestrial spheres can fit inside
            this planet! In addition, the ice giant is about 4 times wider than the Earth. To better understand the size
            of Uranus, take a look at the NASA image, which shows the sizes of all the planets relative to each other.

                    <span class="text-info h3"> The orbit and rotation of Uranus?</span> <br>
                    Studying the orbit of Uranus helped astronomers discover Neptune. French scientist Pierre-Simon
                    Laplace calculated the orbit of Uranus in 1783, but over time differences between the predicted and
                    observed position of the planet were discovered. Astronomers have suggested that some cosmic body
                    interferes with the movement of the ice giant. Thanks to this assumption, they were able to
                    determine the distance from the Sun to an unknown object and its approximate mass, and subsequently
                    discovered Neptune.
                    Tilt of the rotation axis
                    Uranus rotates at an angle of 97.77 °, that is, the axis of rotation of Uranus is almost parallel to
                    the plane of its orbit. This is the most unusual axis of rotation among all the planets of the Solar
                    System; for comparison, Neptune, which is next door, rotates at an angle of 28.5 °
                    As a result, at the solstices on this planet, one of the poles of Uranus is always directed at the
                    Sun. Each pole of Uranus has been in darkness for 42 Earth years and has been illuminated by the Sun
                    for another 42 years. At the same time, at the moments of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator
                    of the planet, which leads to the “usual” change of day and night — similar to that on other
                    planets.
                    It is not yet known why Uranus has such an unusual tilt of the axis of rotation. Scientists believe
                    that this giant planet “turned on its side” 3-4 billion years ago due to one or more collisions with
                    another space object. By the way, the same collision could lead to an unusual rotation of Uranus.
                    The ice giant (like Venus) rotates clockwise, while the other planets of the Solar System rotate
                    counterclockwise, that is, in the same direction as the Sun.

                    <span class="text-info h3">How long does a year last on Uranus?</span> <br>
                    Uranus takes 84 Earth years to complete one revolution around the Sun. In 2033, the ice giant will
                    make the third complete revolution around our star since the discovery of the planet in 1781.
                    Due to the distance of the planet from the Sun, the stellar and solar days on Uranus are almost
                    equal — the first last 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds, and the second for a second less. The
                    duration of one year on Uranus is 42,718 Uranian solar days.
