          Along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Jupiter is considered a giant
          planet (they are also called the planets of the Jovian group. When our
          ancestors called Jupiter in honor of the king of all the gods, they
          did not even know about the size of this planet and how Jupiter really
          fits this name. The size of Jupiter.Jupiter is the largest planet in
          the Solar System — its radius is 69,911 km, and its mass is more than
          twice the total mass of all other planets in the Solar System. For
          comparison, the radius of the second largest planet, Saturn, is 58,232
          km.To make it easier to understand the size of Jupiter, imagine that
          about 1,300 terrestrial spheres could fit inside this huge planet.
          Here's another comparison: if the gas giant was the size of a
          basketball, then our Earth would be the size of a grape.

          <span class="text-info h3">The orbit and rotation of Jupiter</span>
          <br />
          Each planet of the Solar System takes a certain amount of time to make
          one revolution around the Sun and one revolution around its axis.
          Since we live on Earth, we take the Earth day (24 hours) and the earth
          year (365.25 days) as the time standard. Now let's see how the
          duration of days and years on Jupiter differs from the earth. How long
          does one day last on Jupiter? Jupiter is not only the largest planet,
          but also the fastest — it makes one revolution around its axis faster
          than other planets. One day on this planet lasts less than ten hours:
          the exact time varies from 9 hours 56 minutes at the poles to 9 hours
          50 minutes at the equator. The fact is that Jupiter is a gas giant, so
          it cannot move in the same way as planets with a solid sphere.
          Instead, it rotates a little faster around the poles, which leads to a
          difference in the length of the day.

            >How long does one year last on Jupiter?</span
          >
          <br />
          One Jovian year lasts 11,8618 Earth years or 4,332.59 Earth days. When
          compared with other planets, Saturn's orbital period is about 29 Earth
          years, and little Mercury makes one revolution around the Sun in 88
          Earth days. How far is Jupiter? Jupiter is the fifth planet from the
          Sun: they are separated by Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. In
          addition, an asteroid belt is located between the orbits of Mars and
          Jupiter.

          <span class="text-info h3">Distance from Jupiter to the Sun</span>
          <br />
          The gas giant is located at a distance of 5.2 AU from the Sun or 778
          million km. For comparison, Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, is
          located at a distance of 0.4 AU from it, which is approximately equal
          to 58 million km. If you suddenly forgot, we remind you: one
          astronomical unit (AU) is equal to the distance between the Sun and
          the Earth.

          <span class="text-info h3">Distance from Jupiter to Earth</span><br />
          As the planets move in their orbits, the distance between them is
          constantly changing. At the maximum approach to the Earth, Jupiter is
          at a distance of 588 million km from us, and during the greatest
          distance the distance is 989 million km.

          If you plan to fly past the planet and not linger on it, then, on
          average, you will need 550-650 days. Voyager 1, for example, took 546
          days, and Voyager 2 reached Jupiter in 688 days. However, if you plan
          to get into orbit, then you will need much more time — in order not to
          fly past, the spacecraft needs to slow down. So Galileo, NASA's
          spacecraft, took 2,242 days to reach the gas giant. What is Jupiter
          made of? Jupiter has no solid surface; its atmosphere becomes denser
          closer to the center of the planet, turning into a liquid layer that
          surrounds the core. Simply put, this means that Jupiter's atmosphere
          makes up almost the entire planet. It consists of 90% hydrogen and 10%
          helium — this composition is very similar to the Sun.
