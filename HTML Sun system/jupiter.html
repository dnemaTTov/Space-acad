            Along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Jupiter is considered a giant planet (they are also called the
            planets of the Jovian group. When our ancestors called Jupiter in honor of the king of all the gods, they
            did not even know about the size of this planet and how Jupiter really fits this name.
            The size of Jupiter.Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System — its radius is 69,911 km, and its
            mass is more than twice the total mass of all other planets in the Solar System. For comparison, the radius
            of the second largest planet, Saturn, is 58,232 km.To make it easier to understand the size of Jupiter,
            imagine that about 1,300 terrestrial spheres could fit inside this huge planet. Here's another comparison:
            if the gas giant was the size of a basketball, then our Earth would be the size of a grape.

            <span class="text-info h3">The orbit and rotation of Jupiter</span> <br>
            Each planet of the Solar System takes a certain amount of time to make one revolution around the Sun and
            one revolution around its axis. Since we live on Earth, we take the Earth day (24 hours) and the earth
            year (365.25 days) as the time standard. Now let's see how the duration of days and years on Jupiter
            differs from the earth.
            How long does one day last on Jupiter?
            Jupiter is not only the largest planet, but also the fastest — it makes one revolution around its axis
            faster than other planets. One day on this planet lasts less than ten hours: the exact time varies from
            9 hours 56 minutes at the poles to 9 hours 50 minutes at the equator. The fact is that Jupiter is a gas
            giant, so it cannot move in the same way as planets with a solid sphere. Instead, it rotates a little
            faster around the poles, which leads to a difference in the length of the day.

            <span class="text-info h3">How long does one year last on Jupiter?</span> <br>
            One Jovian year lasts 11,8618 Earth years or 4,332.59 Earth days. When compared with other planets,
            Saturn's orbital period is about 29 Earth years, and little Mercury makes one revolution around the Sun
            in 88 Earth days.
            How far is Jupiter?
            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun: they are separated by Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. In
            addition, an asteroid belt is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

            <span class="text-info h3">Distance from Jupiter to the Sun</span> <br>
            The gas giant is located at a distance of 5.2 AU from the Sun or 778 million km. For comparison,
            Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, is located at a distance of 0.4 AU from it, which is
            approximately equal to 58 million km. If you suddenly forgot, we remind you: one astronomical unit (AU)
            is equal to the distance between the Sun and the Earth.

            <span class="text-info h3">Distance from Jupiter to Earth</span><br>
            As the planets move in their orbits, the distance between them is constantly changing. At the maximum
            approach to the Earth, Jupiter is at a distance of 588 million km from us, and during the greatest
            distance the distance is 989 million km.

            <span class="text-info h3">How long does it take to get to Jupiter?</span>
            If you plan to fly past the planet and not linger on it, then, on average, you will need 550-650 days.
            Voyager 1, for example, took 546 days, and Voyager 2 reached Jupiter in 688 days. However, if you plan
            to get into orbit, then you will need much more time — in order not to fly past, the spacecraft needs to
            slow down. So Galileo, NASA's spacecraft, took 2,242 days to reach the gas giant.
            What is Jupiter made of?
            Jupiter has no solid surface; its atmosphere becomes denser closer to the center of the planet, turning
            into a liquid layer that surrounds the core. Simply put, this means that Jupiter's atmosphere makes up
            almost the entire planet. It consists of 90% hydrogen and 10% helium — this composition is very similar
            to the Sun.
