            The exact date of the discovery of Venus is unknown: since this bright planet can be easily seen with the
            naked eye, astronomers around the world have observed it since time immemorial. So we don't know for sure
            who discovered Venus. However, Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei are credited with classifying Venus
            as a planet. The latter made the first accurate observation of Venus in 1610: with the help of a telescope,
            Galileo discovered the phases of Venus, similar to the moon. This discovery confirmed the Copernican theory,
            according to which the planets revolve around the Sun, and not vice versa.

            Which is bigger: Venus or Earth?
            Venus is slightly smaller than Earth: the diameter of this second planet closest to the Sun is 12,104 km. In
            addition, the mass of Venus is about 81% of the mass of our planet.

            <span class="text-info h3">How long is a day on Venus?</span> <br>
            The rotation of Venus around its axis is very slow: the planet takes about 243 Earth days to complete one
            revolution.How long is a year on Venus?Paradoxically, one Venusian day is longer than one Venusian year,
            since Venus completes an orbit around the Sun in 225 Earth days.

            What is the distance from Venus to the Sun?
            Venus is the second farthest planet from the Sun; the distance from it to our star is approximately 70% of
            the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Venus has the lowest orbital eccentricity among the planets of the
            solar system, so the difference between the minimum (107.4 million km) and maximum (108.9 million km)
            distance from it to the Sun is small. On average, Venus is at a distance of 108.2 million km from the Sun.

            The planet Earth has its only satellite - the Moon. The first to describe the properties and characteristics
            of the moon was the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, he described the mountains, craters and plains on
            the surface of the moon, and in 1651 the astronomer Giovanni Riccioli wrote a map of the visible side of the
            lunar surface. In the 20th century, on February 3, 1966, the Luna-9 descent module landed on the Moon for
            the first time, and a few years later, on July 21, 1969, a human foot set foot on the Moon for the first
            time.
            The moon is always turned to the planet Earth with only one of its sides. On this visible side of the Moon,
            flat "seas", chains of mountains and multiple craters of various sizes are visible. The other side,
            invisible from the Earth, has on the surface a large cluster of mountains and even more craters, and the
            light reflecting from the Moon, thanks to which we can see it at night in a pale lunar color, is weakly
            reflected rays from the Sun.
            The planet Earth and its satellite the Moon are very different in many properties, while the ratio of stable
            oxygen isotopes for the planet Earth and its satellite the Moon is the same. Conducted radiometric studies
            have shown that the age of both celestial bodies is the same, approximately 4.5 billion years. These data
            give rise to the assumption that the Moon and the Earth originated from the same substance, which gives rise
            to several interesting hypotheses about the origin of the Moon: from the origin from the same protoplanetary
            cloud, the capture of the Moon by the Earth, and to the formation of the Moon from the collision of the
            Earth with a large object.
