            The atmosphere of Mars is sparse and 95% consists of carbon dioxide, it also contains nitrogen, argon and
            oxygen. The surface of the planet is covered with craters, volcanoes and canyons. It is assumed that in the
            distant past Mars could have been covered with water. For unexplained reasons, whether due to the absence of
            a magnetic field, or due to a geological catastrophe (for example, the fall of a very large asteroid or even
            a planetesimal), the planet lost its magnetic field, and due to the solar wind soon lost both the oceans and
            most of the atmosphere. Thanks to the spacecraft, evidence of the existence of water ice in the Martian soil
            was obtained. The temperature on the planet's surface ranges from -150 ° C to +20 °C.
            It is the seventh largest among the planets of the Solar system, clearly visible from Earth with the naked
            eye. Mars is one of the most studied planets by man. The first close-up images of the planet were obtained
            in 1965. To date, both orbital stations have participated in the study of Mars (Viking, Mariner — USA, Mars
            — USSR programs/Russia), as well as landers and rovers (Opportunity, Curiosity — USA). In 2016, the
            international ExoMars mission began its work. The Misssia lander — Schiaparelli — crashed during landing,
            falling to the surface of the planet at a speed of up to 300 km/h.
            The Earth's atmosphere is conditionally divided into layers that differ in density, temperature and
            composition: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, exosphere.

            The average distance from Mars to the Sun is 228 million kilometers (1.52 astronomical units).
            Perihelion (the closest point of the orbit to the Sun): 206.655 million kilometers (1,381 astronomical
            units).
            Aphelion (the farthest point of the orbit from the Sun): 249,232 million kilometers (1,666 astronomical
            units).
            The average speed of Mars in orbit is about 24 kilometers per second.
            The planet makes one revolution around the Sun in 799.94 Earth days.
            The duration of the day on Mars is 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.7 seconds. One Martian day is called sol.
            The Martian year consists of 668.6 Martian solar days (sols).
            The distance from Mars to Earth varies from 55.76 to 401 million kilometers.The direction of rotation of
            Mars corresponds to the direction of rotation of all (except Venus and Uranus) planets of the Solar system.

            Mars is the seventh largest planet in the Solar System.
            The temperature on the surface of Mars ranges from -153 to +35 °C.
            The radius of Mars is 3389 kilometers (53% of the radius of the Earth).
            The surface area of Mars is 144.37 million square kilometers (28.3% of the Earth's surface).
            The average density of Mars is 3,930 kilograms per cubic meter (71.3% of the earth's density).
            The acceleration of gravity on Mars is 3.711 meters per second squared (0.378 g).
            The mass of Mars is 6.4171 x 1023 kilograms, which is about 10.7% of the mass of the Earth.

            The atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is 160 times less than that of Earth.
            The atmosphere of Mars mainly consists of carbon dioxide (95.32%), nitrogen, argon, oxygen, water vapor,
            carbon monoxide and other components are also present in the composition.
            The average atmospheric pressure on Mars is 0.4-0.87 kPa.
            The climate on Mars, as on our planet, is seasonal due to the angle of inclination of the axis of 25.2
            degrees.
            The northern hemisphere of Mars is characterized by mild winters and cool summers, while the southern
            hemisphere has colder winters and hotter summers.
            The northern and southern polar caps of Mars consist of two components: seasonal carbon dioxide and age-old
            water ice.
            Mars is characterized by dust storms, including those covering the entire planet, as in 2018.

            <span class="text-info h3">Mars Exploration</span><br>
            Mars is the most explored (after Earth) planet in the Solar System.
            Soviet Mars research included the Mars program, under which four generations of automatic interplanetary
            stations were launched from 1962 to 1973, as well as the Phobos program – two automatic interplanetary
            stations designed to explore Mars and its satellite Phobos.
            ExoMars is a joint program of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian state corporation Roscosmos to
            explore the Red Planet, the main purpose of which is to search for evidence of the existence of life on Mars
            in the past and present.
            Currently, NASA's Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, the InSight research lander are working on the surface
            of Mars, and several orbiters of various space agencies are continuously working in orbit.
