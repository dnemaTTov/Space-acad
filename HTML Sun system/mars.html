          The atmosphere of Mars is sparse and 95% consists of carbon dioxide,
          it also contains nitrogen, argon and oxygen. The surface of the planet
          is covered with craters, volcanoes and canyons. It is assumed that in
          the distant past Mars could have been covered with water. For
          unexplained reasons, whether due to the absence of a magnetic field,
          or due to a geological catastrophe (for example, the fall of a very
          large asteroid or even a planetesimal), the planet lost its magnetic
          field, and due to the solar wind soon lost both the oceans and most of
          the atmosphere. Thanks to the spacecraft, evidence of the existence of
          water ice in the Martian soil was obtained. The temperature on the
          planet's surface ranges from -150 ° C to +20 °C. It is the seventh
          largest among the planets of the Solar system, clearly visible from
          Earth with the naked eye. Mars is one of the most studied planets by
          man. The first close-up images of the planet were obtained in 1965. To
          date, both orbital stations have participated in the study of Mars
          (Viking, Mariner — USA, Mars — USSR programs/Russia), as well as
          landers and rovers (Opportunity, Curiosity — USA). In 2016, the
          international ExoMars mission began its work. The Misssia lander —
          Schiaparelli — crashed during landing, falling to the surface of the
          planet at a speed of up to 300 km/h. The Earth's atmosphere is
          conditionally divided into layers that differ in density, temperature
          and composition: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere,
          ionosphere, exosphere.

          The average distance from Mars to the Sun is 228 million kilometers
          (1.52 astronomical units). Perihelion (the closest point of the orbit
          to the Sun): 206.655 million kilometers (1,381 astronomical units).
          Aphelion (the farthest point of the orbit from the Sun): 249,232
          million kilometers (1,666 astronomical units). The average speed of
          Mars in orbit is about 24 kilometers per second. The planet makes one
          revolution around the Sun in 799.94 Earth days. The duration of the
          day on Mars is 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.7 seconds. One Martian day is
          called sol. The Martian year consists of 668.6 Martian solar days
          (sols). The distance from Mars to Earth varies from 55.76 to 401
          million kilometers.The direction of rotation of Mars corresponds to
          the direction of rotation of all (except Venus and Uranus) planets of
          the Solar system.

          <br />
          Mars is the seventh largest planet in the Solar System. The
          temperature on the surface of Mars ranges from -153 to +35 °C. The
          radius of Mars is 3389 kilometers (53% of the radius of the Earth).
          The surface area of Mars is 144.37 million square kilometers (28.3% of
          the Earth's surface). The average density of Mars is 3,930 kilograms
          per cubic meter (71.3% of the earth's density). The acceleration of
          gravity on Mars is 3.711 meters per second squared (0.378 g). The mass
          of Mars is 6.4171 x 1023 kilograms, which is about 10.7% of the mass
          of the Earth.

          <br />
          The atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is 160 times less than
          that of Earth. The atmosphere of Mars mainly consists of carbon
          dioxide (95.32%), nitrogen, argon, oxygen, water vapor, carbon
          monoxide and other components are also present in the composition. The
          average atmospheric pressure on Mars is 0.4-0.87 kPa. The climate on
          Mars, as on our planet, is seasonal due to the angle of inclination of
          the axis of 25.2 degrees. The northern hemisphere of Mars is
          characterized by mild winters and cool summers, while the southern
          hemisphere has colder winters and hotter summers. The northern and
          southern polar caps of Mars consist of two components: seasonal carbon
          dioxide and age-old water ice. Mars is characterized by dust storms,
          including those covering the entire planet, as in 2018.

          Mars is the most explored (after Earth) planet in the Solar System.
          Soviet Mars research included the Mars program, under which four
          generations of automatic interplanetary stations were launched from
          1962 to 1973, as well as the Phobos program – two automatic
          interplanetary stations designed to explore Mars and its satellite
          Phobos. ExoMars is a joint program of the European Space Agency (ESA)
          and the Russian state corporation Roscosmos to explore the Red Planet,
          the main purpose of which is to search for evidence of the existence
          of life on Mars in the past and present. Currently, NASA's Opportunity
          and Curiosity rovers, the InSight research lander are working on the
          surface of Mars, and several orbiters of various space agencies are
          continuously working in orbit.
